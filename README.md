# Pewlitt-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Pewlit-Hackard is a large company of 240,124 employees as of 7/24/22.  With that many employees it is important to keep track of how many are retiring so that there are not a large number of vacant positions at once.  This can impact external customers as the company scrambles to correct the worker shortage.  In order to be proactive and reduce the impact of a coming wave of retirees, I have completed several queries on the PH-EmployeeDB database to determine how many are close to retiring age, which departments will see shortages, and who might be good employee candidates for a mentorship program to utilize their years of experience before they leave the company.  Using this information, Human Resources can begin recruiting to fill positions before the potential "silver tsunami" hits.

## Results
INSERT Retire_Count table
- From this table you can see that Engineers are going to be heavily impacted by retirement in the near future.  Between Senior Engineers, Engineers, and Assitant Engineers, there is the potential deficit of 36,291 engineers of various levels.  Therefore, recruitment for engineers and promotion of engineers and Assistant Engineers should be prioritized to fill that need.  Perhaps the mentorship program would be able to assist in both the hiring of new engineers and preparing the non-retiring engineers to move up and fill the senior positions.

- The next largest category for recruitment is in Senior Staff and Staff.
